# Bank-Marketing-Model

## INTRODUCTION
It is a known fact that term deposit helps the bank to invest better to make profit. This also allows the bank to insist customer to get insurance, loans, and other services.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
One of the Portuguese banking institutions held a direct marketing campaign. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (&#39;yes&#39;) or not (&#39;no&#39;) subscribed.

The information about the same is available in the dataset.

## OBJECTIVE
  - Gather available customer’s data, age, campaign outcome’s data and usage pattern
  - Convert structured and unstructured data/information into meaningful insights
  - Utilize these insights to predict clients who are likely to subscribe

## TECHNOLOGY USED
  - Windows 11
  - Jupyter Notebook

## DATASET
The dataset comprises of:
  - 45211 rows
  - 17 columns

There are a total of 16 features and 1 target variable.

## METHODOLOGY
This work aims to predict whether a customer will subscribe to term deposit or not.

  - IMPORTING NECESSARY LIBRARIES
    - Necessary libraries are imported that are required for data analysis, visualization, and model building.
  - IMPORTING DATASET AND PREPARATION
    - The ‘bank-full’ dataset is imported. The dataset is cleaned by removing missing values and outliers. Some of the categorical variables are converted to numerical values.
  - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
    - Visualization and analysis are performed on the cleaned dataset. Insights are drawn out that will help in feature selection.
  - FEATURE SELECTION
    - Features and the target variable are set by dropping and assigning the columns respectively.
  - TRAIN-TEST SPLIT
    - Train-Test split is performed. The entire dataset is split into train and test dataset.
  - MODEL BUILDING
    - After having a good understanding of data, a model is built to predict the outcome.
  - MODEL EVALUATION
    - The performance of the model is evaluated. Metrics such as as accuracy, precision, and recall are used.
